# AJK16 Workflow
[(Homepage)](http://localhost:3000/)
In this course we will describe how an effective workflow looks like. We will show you step by step what we use for methods and why we chose a bunch of different techniques. The application we have built is a simple search engine for finding pictures via Pixabay.

## Installation
```sh
clone project
cd web
npm install
npm start
```

## Scaffold
> This project was scaffolded by React CLI [(create-react-app)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
 We chose to use the React CLI because of its agility and logistics. A big advantage is that at the smallest change in  the code, the website updates in real time so you do not need to refresh the website continuously.

> To handle the responsivity we used flexbox witch is a built in CSS tool. We used it because it's easy to work with and doesn't require you to type a massive amount of code.

> We also created a repo on Github. This makes it much easier for the group while we are working on the project. Some of us has also been using GitKraken witch is a git GUI that makes the hole GIT process faster.

## Develop
> Fyll i om develop

## Test
> The tests are done with Jest, a testing framework maintained by Facebook.
```sh
npm test
```

## Integrate
> Fyll i om integrering

## Optimize
> [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) is a build tool that bundles all of your assets, including Javascript, images, fonts, and CSS. Webpack was included when we where scaffolding our react application. This makes it easier to manage "modules" which can be used for minifying, testing and more... <i>Note that Webpack is not a task runner but can solve the same problems as as Gulp and Grunt solves. </i>

## Deploy
> Fyll i om deploy


## Software
