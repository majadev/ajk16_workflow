# AJK16 Workflow


In this course we will describe to you how an effective workflow looks like. We will show you step by step what we use for methods and why we chose a bunch of different techniques. The application we have built is a simple search engine for finding pictures via Pixabay.

## Webpack - module bundler
> [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) is a build tool that bundles all of your assets, including Javascript, images, fonts, and CSS. Webpack was included when we where scaffolding our react application. This makes it easier to manage "modules" which can be used for minifying, testing and more... <i>Note that Webpack is not a task runner but can solve the same problems as as Gulp and Grunt solves. </i>
